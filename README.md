WAR is a simple card game typically played by 2 players using a standard card Deck.
The Deck (new_deck.all_cards **[52 cards]**) is divided evenly among the players, giving each a stack of 26 cards.
Each Player reveals the top card of their deck --this is a "battle"-- and the player with the higher card takes both of the cards played and moves them to the bottom of their stack.
If 2 cards played are of equal value, then there's a war. Each player will check whether they have enough cards to declare a war, a player who doesn't have enough cards to declare a war loses immediately.
Both players will draw more 5 cards each from the bottom of the stack **(with 4 from each player facing down and 1 from each player facing up)** and place them on the table **(table will have 12 cards at this point)**.
The owner of the higher face-up card wins the war and adds all the cards on the table(12 cards) to the bottom of their deck.
If the face-up cards are again equal then the war repeats with another face-down/up cards. This repeats until one player's face-up card is higher than their opponent's.
If a player runs out of cards and they can't declare a war, that player loses immediately.
